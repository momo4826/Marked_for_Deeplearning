## Datasets
1. [CrowdData](https://github.com/TrentoCrowdAI/crowdsourced-datasets)
> CrowdData is an open repository that aggregates the crowdsourced datasets that have individual crowd votes. We aim at providing the available datasets with a standard format (explained in Download section below) so that they can be directly used in experiments, without any work-load in preprocessing. Datasets included in this repo serve for classification tasks (mainly text classification, except Emotion Dataset). 

2. [Awesome collections on DataHub](https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data)
> The awesome section presents collections of high quality datasets organized by topic.
